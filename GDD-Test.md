## 2. Gameplay Mechanics

### 2.1 Core Gameplay
- **Objective**: Identify and fix bugs in code snippets to make them run correctly, earning points based on speed, accuracy, and efficiency.
- **Challenge Structure**:
  - Players are presented with a code snippet containing bugs (e.g., syntax errors, logical errors, runtime issues).
  - Players edit the code in an in-game editor (powered by Monaco Editor) to fix bugs.
  - Success is measured by passing test cases, with feedback on errors or inefficiencies.
- **Progressive Difficulty**:
  - **Beginner**: Syntax errors, simple logic fixes (e.g., incorrect operators in Python).
  - **Intermediate**: Algorithmic bugs, edge cases (e.g., array out-of-bounds in JavaScript).
  - **Expert**: Complex debugging (e.g., memory leaks in C++, async issues in JavaScript).
- **Time-Based Challenges**: Each puzzle has a configurable time limit (e.g., 2–10 minutes) to add urgency.
- **Daily Challenges**: A new puzzle daily, with unique themes or constraints to keep content fresh.

### 2.2 Supported Languages
- Python, JavaScript, Java, C++
- Players select their preferred language for each challenge, with equivalent logic across languages.
- Backend validates solutions using language-specific compilers/interpreters.

### 2.3 Scoring System
- **Points**:
  - **Accuracy**: Correctly fixing all bugs (50% of score).
  - **Speed**: Time taken compared to optimal time (30% of score).
  - **Efficiency**: Code quality, e.g., minimal lines or optimal algorithms (20% of score).
- **Bonuses**: Extra points for first-time solves, daily streak maintenance, or tournament wins.

## 3. Game Systems

### 3.1 User Management
- **Profile System**:
  - Tracks player stats: puzzles solved, average time, success rate, favorite language.
  - Displays achievements, badges, and leaderboard rankings.
  - Customizable avatars with coding-themed cosmetics (e.g., pixelated keyboards, neon bugs).
- **Progress Streaks**:
  - Daily login and puzzle-solving streaks grant bonus points or cosmetic rewards.
  - Streaks reset after 24 hours of inactivity to encourage consistent engagement.

### 3.2 Competition Systems
- **Leaderboard**:
  - **Global**: Ranks all players by total points.
  - **Category-Specific**: Ranks by language (e.g., Python leaderboard) or difficulty tier.
  - Updated in real-time via WebSocket for dynamic rankings.
- **Tournament Mode**:
  - Weekly events where players compete in timed debugging challenges.
  - Bracket-style or point-based formats, with top players advancing.
  - Real-time multiplayer via WebSocket for head-to-head debugging duels.
- **Hall of Fame**:
  - **Quiz of the Day (QOTD)**: Showcases daily challenge top performers.
  - **Weekly Contest**: Highlights tournament winners.
  - **Global**: All-time top players, with permanent recognition.

### 3.3 Recognition System
- **Certified Badges System**:
  - Badges for milestones (e.g., “Python Bug Slayer” for 50 Python puzzles solved).
  - Skill-based certifications (e.g., “Async Master” for JavaScript async/await challenges).
  - Displayed on profiles and shareable on social platforms (e.g., X).

### 3.4 Community Features
- **User-Generated Content (UGC)**:
  - Players can create custom debugging challenges using a web-based editor.
  - Challenges are moderated by admins or community votes before going live.
  - Creators earn points when their challenges are solved by others.
- **Report Bug or Quiz Issue**:
  - Players can flag issues with puzzles (e.g., unclear instructions, broken test cases).
  - Community-driven feedback system, with reports sent to moderators via backend.

## 4. Visual and Audio Design

### 4.1 Art Style
- **Theme**: Retro-futuristic, pixel-art aesthetic inspired by 8-bit coding and gaming culture.
- **UI**: Clean, modern interface with neon accents, resembling a code editor (e.g., VS Code).
- **Visuals**:
  - Code snippets displayed in a Monaco Editor-inspired window.
  - Animations for bug fixes (e.g., pixelated “bug” sprites dissolve when solved).
  - Avatars and badges with pixelated, gaming-themed designs.

### 4.2 Audio
